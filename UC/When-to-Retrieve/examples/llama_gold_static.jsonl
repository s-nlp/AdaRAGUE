{"prompt": "Given the following information: \nPassage-0The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena . The euglena 's eyespot , called a stigma , is located at its anterior end . It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles . By detecting the subtle changes in night - time illumination , organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation .\nAnswer the following question based on the given information or your internal knowledge with one or few words.\nQuestion: what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "question": "what is the first step in the evolution of the eye", "Res": "The first step in the evolution of the eye is believed to be the development of photoreceptor proteins, or \"eyespots,\" in unicellular organisms.", "has_answer": 1}

To determine whether the past , present , or future of motoring is best , the presenters visit Switzerland with Clarkson in a petrol powered Lamborghini Aventador S representing the past , May in a hybrid powered Honda NSX representing the present , and Hammond in an all - electric Rimac Concept One representing the future . After starting at the top of the Gotthard Pass , Hammond brings the trio to a stay at the Park Weggis ( de ) health retreat and visit the Swiss Museum of Transport and other museums in Lucerne close to a charging station for the Rimac car . May and Clarkson reject this and go to a hill climbing race at Hemberg instead . As Clarkson can not fit into the Aventador whilst wearing a mandatory racing helmet , Clarkson sends a Lamborghini test driver in his place , thus setting the fastest time of all three . Hammond crashes after completing the course , destroying the Rimac in a fire . Footage taken from YouTube shows the wreckage being extinguished and Hammond being airlifted by the Swiss Air - Rescue ( REGA ) to hospital . The presenters discuss some inapropriate new features within cars on Conversation Street . Celebrity Brain Crash is replaced by Celebrity Face Off , in which Ricky Wilson beats David Hasselhoff to determine who the `` fastest former talent show host '' is . 15 `` The Falls Guys '' Ford GT , Mercedes AMG GT R Kevin Pietersen , Brian Wilson 15 December 2017 ( 2017 - 12 - 15 ) The presenters race from Central Park in Manhattan , New York City , to an observation tower overlooking the Niagara Falls . Clarkson drives the new Ford GT whilst May and Hammond ( on crutches ) use public transport , taking the New York City Subway , AirTrain JFK , a JetBlue Embraer E190 flight , plus two Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority buses .

In `` Celebrity Face Off '' , Kevin Pietersen of South Africa beats Brian Wilson of the U.S. as the `` fastest person who makes a living throwing and hitting and catching small balls '' . 16 `` Bah Humbug - atti '' Kia Stinger GT , Bugatti Chiron Hugh Bonneville , Casey Anderson 22 December 2017 ( 2017 - 12 - 22 ) The presenters begin with Christmas tree lights made from vehicle parts and , Starting with Scalextric , they exchange humorous and inappropriate Christmas gifts in Conversation Street . May travels to Majorca to race a Kia Stinger GT against a pair of longboard riders along a mountain road , with May winning the race despite him racing uphill and the riders downhill . Hammond and May attempt to relieve lunchtime boredom by inventing `` lunchtime office car park racing '' at Houghton Hall business park in the Luton / Dunstable Urban Area . After brief interviews in which both share their own ownership of a Tesla Model S , Hugh Bonneville , representing the UK , and Casey Anderson , representing the United States , compete during `` Celebrity Face Off '' as the `` fastest person who lives with a bear '' , with Anderson winning by setting the faster lap time . Clarkson experiments with the jet set lifestyle , starting in the morning from the Da Vinci super-yacht moored in Saint - Tropez and then driving a Bugatti Chiron to L'Alpe De Venosc France for skiing at lunchtime , stopping briefly for a drag race against a BMW M4 at Gap -- Tallard Airport to give viewers a perspective on how fast the Chiron is . After leaving the Alps , Clarkson then pays an homage to the 1976 film C'\u00e9tait un rendez - vous , by speeding across Turin and reaching the Piazza Carignano ( it ) in 9 minutes . 17 `` Unscripted '' McLaren 720S , Audi TT RS , Ariel Nomad Michael Ball , Alfie Boe , Silvija Jurin 29 December 2017 ( 2017 - 12 - 29 ) The presenters begin by having a year - ending awards ceremony in Conversation Street . Hammond heads to the Eboladrome to test the McLaren 720S after which Eaton sets a lap time . Since The Grand Tour has been criticised for being too `` scripted '' , the presenters head to Zadar county and the island of Pag in Croatia to make a completely `` unscripted '' film . This results in Clarkson turning up in the Audi TT RS , Hammond turning up in the not at all comparable Ariel Nomad , and May turning up in an old Lada Riva which he turns into a fire engine . They go their separate ways though Clarkson and Hammond end up comparing their cars in a drag race , a rally stage ( both of which are won by Clarkson ) , visiting Maslenica , the Plitvice Lakes National Park , and following the D106 road until running out of road at \u017digljen ferry port . Due to a lack of fires , May has to setup his own ones until Clarkson and Hammond setup one that proves too difficult for May , which the real fire brigade manage to put out with a firefighting aircraft , destroying May 's Lada fire engine in the process .

{"prompt": "Given the following information: \nPassage-0It was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre ( 147 ft ) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern . Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue .

{"prompt": "Given the following information: \nPassage-0Gavin Shipman ( Mathew Horne ) - Gavin is 28 when the series starts . He is an only child , and when the series starts he still lives with his loving mother and father in Billericay , Essex . He gets on well with his parents . He works for a company called ICB and spends his spare time with his best friend Smithy ( James Corden ) along with his other friends Gary & Simon , Dirtbox , Fingers , Budgie , Swede , Chinese Alan and Jesus . He is a big fan of Tottenham Hotspur ( as is Mathew Horne ) and is often seen wearing his Spurs shirt . In the course of his job , he had to deal with a company called Bedmores , based in Barry . The Bedmores representative he had to correspond with was a woman called Stacey West ( Joanna Page ) . Gavin and Stacey had to speak regularly because of their jobs , and they found they got on very well . After months and months of talking and flirting , they agreed to meet up in London . They agreed that Gavin would bring his best friend Smithy with him , and Stacey would bring her best friend Nessa ( Ruth Jones ) with her . They met up and went clubbing . They had a great time , and got on very well . They went back to Stacey 's hotel room and had sex . The next day , Stacey had to go back to Barry , but she and Gavin promised to keep ringing each other and that this would not be the end of their relationship . While Stacey and Nessa boarded the coach back to Barry , Gavin and Smithy got a cab back to Billericay . Without waiting for Smithy , Gavin jumped in his car and drove all the way to Barry , and met Stacey when her coach pulled into the station , to her surprise . He and Stacey told each other they loved each other for the first time . Within 9 weeks , they had got engaged and married . Despite a few initial problems regarding Stacey being homesick , their relationship was successful , and Stacey became eventually pregnant . Gavin , and his father Mick ( Larry Lamb ) , often play the `` straight men '' in the series . Much of the comedy comes from the actions of those around them ( especially his mother Pam ( Alison Steadman ) and Smithy ) . It is clear that Gavin loves his friends and family very much . Despite the fact that his mother Pam often overreacts and acts without thinking , Gavin still loves her , despite being occasionally exasperated by her . His best friend Smithy is also prone to overreact , but Gavin sticks with him and loves him like a little brother . Gavin 's main personality flaw is that he is slightly spoiled , possibly due to being an only child , and reacts with irritation when he does n't get his way . He is also not particularly sensitive - he sometimes fails to understand the much more emotional Smithy and Stacey , and this occasionally puts strain on his relationship with both of them - when Stacey , who is very attached to her hometown of Barry , gets depressed and homesick upon moving to Billericay after she and Gavin marry , Gavin is more confused than concerned about this , and his responses are lacking in sensitivity about the matter . This can also be seen in the fact that Gavin is less talkative and expressive than Stacey is - while at dinner with their families after their honeymoon , Stacey is excited and full of conversation , while Gavin simply sits and listens to her . Despite all of this , Gavin loves Stacey enormously , and is very affectionate towards her , and his greatest display of love for her is when he decides to move to Barry with her despite having expressed a dislike of it previously , and he manages to get himself a new job in Wales so he can reside there . There , his boss Huw Davies and colleague Owain Hughes ( Steven Meo ) act very similar to Stacey 's uncle , Bryn ( Rob Brydon ) , talking incessantly and being over-friendly , personality traits that bewilder Gavin . Gavin is more reserved and less willing to discuss his private life than his wife . He finds it odd that Stacey is so eager and ready to spill information about their private life to Nessa , Bryn , her mother Gwen ( Melanie Walters ) and her brother Jason ( Robert Wilfort ) . When Gavin is applying for a job in Cardiff , the only people who know are Stacey and Mick . When he and Stacey announce it to the rest of the characters , Gwen announces that she knew as well , because Stacey told her . Gavin is annoyed that Stacey told Gwen , and by the fact that Stacey did not tell him she had told Gwen . He does n't understand why Stacey always has to be so close to her family . It is n't that he is distant from his family , he just does n't depend on his as much as Stacey does hers . In Series 3 , he agrees with Stacey to try to have a baby , only to discover she stopped taking the pill a year ago . Although he is very angry about Stacey not telling him the truth , he becomes much more depressed when he learns that he has fertility problems . However , he eventually comes round , and has a serious discussion with Stacey about the problem , deciding they will carry on trying to conceive for a few months , and if that does n't work , they should start looking at alternatives . However , in the final episode , Stacey discovers she pregnant , and Gavin is completely as overjoyed .\nAnswer the following question based on the given information or your internal knowledge with one or few words.\nQuestion: who plays stacey's mum in gavin and stacey", "question": "who plays stacey's mum in gavin and stacey", "Res": "Joanna Page.", "has_answer": 0}

{"prompt": "Given the following information: \nPassage-0Gestalt psychology or gestaltism ( German : Gestalt ( \u0261\u0259\u02c8\u0283talt ) `` shape , form '' ) is a philosophy of mind of the Berlin School of experimental psychology . Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together .

{"prompt": "Given the following information: \nPassage-0Twisty the Clown ( portrayed by John Carroll Lynch ) originally was a slow - witted but gentle clown at a freak show in 1943 . Jealous of his popularity , the freaks of the carnival spread rumors that he was a child molester and drove him away . With nowhere else to go , he returned home to Jupiter , Florida , only to find that his mother had died . After failing to support himself by selling toys made of junk to a local toy store , Twisty attempted suicide by putting a shotgun in his mouth . However , the attempt failed -- he succeeded only in mutilating his lower jaw -- and he later began to wear a grinning mask over the lower part of his face . Twisty then tried to perform as a clown at Elsa 's freak show , but was turned away . Twisty then snapped and went on a killing spree , abducting children to be his audience , while murdering their `` mean '' parents . He kidnaps Corey Bachman and murders his parents , after kidnapping Bonnie Lipton to serve as his audience 's babysitter . Gloria hires Twisty to entertain Dandy , who becomes his accomplice . Twisty and Dandy hold a magic show on Halloween , before Jimmy knocks Dandy unconscious and Maggie gets Corey and Bonnie to safety . Twisty then knocks Jimmy out before encountering Edward Mordrake , who was attracted by the noise of the clown 's performance . Twisty tells Mordrake his story , and Mordrake deems the clown suitable to be in his entourage of damned souls and kills him . When Elsa summons Mordrake in 1962 , Twisty appears alongside the other freaks and comforts her in her last moments . According to director Ryan Murphy , Lynch was so terrifying as this character that `` half the time , almost a third of the crew left the set when they shot his scenes because they were afraid of him . '' In Cult , a comic book detailing a fictionalized version of Twisty is owned by Oz Mayfair - Richards . Bonnie Lipton ( portrayed by Skyler Samuels ) is a young girl who is kidnapped by Twisty , after Twisty murders her boyfriend Troy . She attacks Twisty and attempts to escape with Corey , but is dragged back to him by Dandy . She escapes Twisty with the help of Jimmy and Maggie in `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' . Regina Ross ( portrayed by Gabourey Sidibe as older Regina , Nya Auzenne as young Regina ) is a student at secretary school hoping to get a position at a law firm after graduation , who returns home to Jupiter when her mother Dora goes MIA . In `` Pink Cupcakes '' , she calls Gloria concerning her mother and why she has n't been returning her calls . The conversation turns strange and Regina feels uncomfortable and hangs up , wary of what happened . She turns up at the Mott Manor in `` Blood Bath '' , very suspicious of where her mother is . She threatens to call the police if she does n't see her mother soon . In `` Tupperware Party Massacre '' , Dandy admits to the murder of Dora and lets Regina escape unharmed , despite her refusal to take a blood bath with him . Upon returning with police detective Jack Colquitt , Dandy admits to the murders and boasts about his family 's wealth , buying off Colquitt for a million dollars . Regina is killed when Dandy orders Colquitt to shoot and bury her . Dora Ross ( portrayed by Patti LaBelle ) is a local townswoman who begins to discover secrets about Dandy . She is the mother of Regina and the put - upon maid to Gloria Mott . In `` Massacres and Matinees '' , she reveals to Gloria that she found dissected animal parts behind the shed , implying they belong to Dandy . She dislikes Dandy 's spoiled attitude and did n't get scared of him when he tried to kill her . In `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' , she dies when Dandy slashes her throat and Gloria helps bury her in their backyard . Paul ( portrayed by Mat Fraser ) also known as Paul The Illustrated Seal is a performer in the freak show , who was born with phocomelia of both arms . In `` Edward Mordrake ( Part 2 ) '' , he tells Mordrake that he immigrated to the United States from Britain to be in show business . However , he arrived during the Great Depression . In an act of despair , he tattooed his whole body except his face , because he believed that it would have been considered handsome and loveable if it was n't on a freak . It is revealed that he is not only Elsa 's secret lover , but that of Penny too , his true love . He confronts Elsa in `` Bullseye '' about the recent disappearance of Bette and Dot , and she in turn snaps at him for his relationship with Penny . She later becomes angry about a public confrontation with the rest of the troupe and demands one of them place themselves on the spinning wheel , to prove their trust of her . Paul volunteers and it is assumed she purposely threw the last knife into his gut , injuring him badly , leaving him bed ridden . He is then shocked and guilt - stricken later on in `` Test of Strength '' over Penny 's mutilation . In `` Curtain Call '' , after trying to stand up to Dandy , he is the first freak to be shot and killed during Dandy 's massacre . He and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife , where he and Penny have gotten married . Eve ( portrayed by Erika Ervin ) also known as Amazon Eve is a performer in the freak show . She is abnormally large . She is seen as the piano player of the show and is also instrumental with protecting the troupe , along with Jimmy and Paul . In `` Bullseye '' , she becomes concerned over Ma Petite 's disappearance until Maggie turns up with her , healthy and alive . Initially , Eve is somewhat quiet and even - tempered , but in `` Test of Strength '' , Dell attempts to murder her in her caravan . Afraid that he is attempting to rape her , Eve defends herself by savagely beating him and throws him out . She goes to Ethel where she cares for her bruised hand . She and the other women of the freak show then plot to kill Dell once and for all . In `` Curtain Call '' , she is the last freak to be killed by Dandy after she tries to overpower him in Desiree 's caravan . She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife . Mahadevi Patel ( portrayed by Jyoti Amge ) also known as Ma Petite , is a performer in the freak show , who also serves as Elsa 's assistant . She is seen playing a miniature violin of sorts and also serves as Elsa 's manicurist and `` cuddle '' toy in the later hours . She was born with achondroplasia which results in an extremely short stature , and is thus deemed the world 's shortest woman . Seen as the baby of the troupe , Ma Petite 's sweet nature and naive innocence leads her to trust almost everyone , with ultimately tragic consequences . Maggie lures her away one night attempts to murder her in `` Bullseye '' for Stanley , but ca n't force herself to go through with it . In `` Test of Strength '' , Dell , under the pretense of gifting her with a new dress , hugs her and then squeezes until her spine snaps and she dies . He gives her body to Stanley and it is later seen being presented by Lillian in her Museum of Morbid Curiosities in a jar of formaldehyde , where her birth name is revealed . The carnies later find her bloody dress in an area full of unidentified bones , and believe that she has been eaten by a wild animal . She later appears to Dell in a hallucination before he attempts suicide by hanging . She and the other freaks appear when Elsa joins the freak show in the afterlife , where Ma Petite once again helps Elsa to get ready for her performance . Lillian Hemmings ( portrayed by Celia Weston ) is the curator of the Museum of Morbid Curiosities ; she collects and buys strange artifacts for her museum . She catches Stanley and Maggie 's fraudulence but says if she is offered something of real worth from a freak show , she will pay big money . Stanley regularly imagines scenarios with her presenting him with money and acclaim for his finds . In `` Test of Strength '' , she unveils her new exhibit to various wealthy people of Ma Petite 's dead body ( presented as Mahadevi Patel , the world 's smallest woman ) , floating in a jar of what is assumed to be formaldehyde . In `` Orphans '' , she is seen revealing Jimmy 's claw hands . In `` Show Stoppers '' , it is revealed that she was murdered by Desiree shortly after Maggie 's fainting spell ; her decapitated and preserved head is given to Stanley before the freaks attack and mutilate him . Penny ( portrayed by Grace Gummer ) is a candy striper at the local hospital . In the first episode , she is drugged and kidnapped by Elsa and taken back with her to the freak show . She is blackmailed by Elsa into staying at the camp because Elsa filmed her in a drug - fueled orgy with the freaks . It is later revealed she is in a relationship with Paul , but her father begins to abuse her over the affair . In `` Test of Strength '' , she attempts to move out but before she can do so , her father Vince hires a man to mutilate her face -- tattooing her with scales , giving her a forked tongue , and shaving half her hair off while she is unconscious . She is accepted by the freak show and takes the name The Astounding Lizard Girl . In `` Blood Bath '' , she and the women of the freak show kidnap her father and feather and tar him for what he did , but she spares his life after being persuaded by Maggie . In `` Curtain Call '' , she is shot and killed during Dandy 's massacre .

{"prompt": "Given the following information: \nPassage-0The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative .\nAnswer the following question based on the given information or your internal knowledge with one or few words.\nQuestion: who gave the famous objective co relative theory", "question": "who gave the famous objective co relative theory", "Res": "T.S.

Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years .\nAnswer the following question based on the given information or your internal knowledge with one or few words.\nQuestion: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany", "question": "who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany", "Res": "Johannes Gutenberg", "has_answer": 1}

{"prompt": "Given the following information: \nPassage-0There was a lengthy dispute over the leadership of the Senate during June and July 2009 . On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges .

Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate . As many as 60 conspirators , led by Brutus and Cassius , were involved . According to Plutarch , a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March . On his way to the Theatre of Pompey , where he would be assassinated , Caesar passed the seer and joked , `` The Ides of March are come '' , implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled , to which the seer replied `` Aye , Caesar ; but not gone .

It first premiered on Canada on July 8 , 2007 and June 5 , 2008 on the United States . This season takes place at Camp Wawanakwa , a fictional island located somewhere in Muskoka , Ontario where the season is based on a summer camp theme ( although a contestant is eliminated at the end of every episode ) . Like the whole series , this season is a competition to see which of the twenty - two contestants will survive and last the longest . This is because the contestants are brutally tortured along the way through the intense challenges they are given . Challenges are sometimes based on other reality shows like Fear Factor and Survivor . All of this is so that the winner of the season ( the one to last the longest on the island and not get eliminated ) , will win a small fortune of C $ 100,000 and cheesy fame . Eliminated contestants are sent packing toward the Dock of Shame and must ride the Boat of Losers off the island . `` Total Drama Action '' 27 Todd Kauffman / Mark Thornton 15 January 11 , 2009 ( 2009 - 01 - 11 ) Total Drama Action is the second season of the series .

Cody , Eva , Ezekiel , Noah , Katie , Sadie , and Tyler do not return to compete , but still appeared for the aftermath special , an extra show which was hosted by Bridgette and Geoff , the first two eliminated contestants . All losers must take the Walk of Shame on the red carpet and ride the Lame - o - sine . `` Total Drama World Tour '' 26 Keith Oliver / Chad Hicks 18 June 10 , 2010 ( 2010 - 06 - 10 ) Total Drama World Tour is the third season of the series . It premiered in 2010 internationally and continued onto 2011 in Canada . In this season , seventeen contestants are taken on a trip around the world as they compete in cultural themed challenges based on the countries or regions that they visit . An added twist in this season is that the contestants are required to break spontaneously into song , or else be immediately eliminated by Chris ( although this rule was not strongly enforced , and no one was eliminated for not singing anyway ) . Fifteen of the original characters from previous returned : Bridgette , Cody , Courtney , DJ , Duncan , Ezekiel , Gwen , Harold , Heather , Izzy , Leshawna , Lindsay , Noah , Owen , and Tyler . Two new characters , Alejandro and Sierra , also joined the cast at the beginning of this season . Additionally , a third new character , Blaineley , was brought on to compete past the halfway point of the season .

Instead , a new set of thirteen contestants compete , which are Anne Maria , B , Brick , Cameron , Dakota , Dawn , Jo , Lightning , Mike , Sam , Scott , Staci , and Zoey . However , some characters from the original cast still have cameo appearances throughout the season . Also , due to the island being abandoned for the past two seasons , Chris had lent the island to a biohazardous waste dump company , causing the island to turn radioactive . This means that causes of radiation and toxic waste is the main theme for this season . This season only contains 13 episodes ( half the length of a regular season ) , and the cash prize is once again C $1,000,000 . People are eliminated off the island by the Hurl of Shame . 5 `` Total Drama All - Stars and Pahkitew Island '' 26 Keith Oliver / Chad Hicks 28 January 9 , 2014 ( 2014 - 01 - 09 ) Total Drama All - Stars and Total Drama : Pahkitew Island both make up the fifth and most recent season of the Total Drama series which were ordered by Cartoon Network in October 2012 as 26 episodes .
