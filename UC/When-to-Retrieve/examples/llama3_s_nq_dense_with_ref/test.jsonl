The equation for this process is as follows:\n\nGlucose (C6H12O6) \u2192 2 Pyruvate (C3H4O3) + 2 ATP + 2 NADH\n\nIn anaerobic conditions, the NADH produced is converted back to NAD+, but since there is no oxygen to oxidize the NADH, the electrons are transferred to pyruvate, resulting in lactate. However, this does not affect the net ATP yield, which remains 2 ATP per glucose molecule.", "Giveup": true, "reference": ["2"]}
