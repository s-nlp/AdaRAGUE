This repository contains all code to reproduce [Adaptive Retrieval without Self-Knowledge? Bringing Uncertainty Back Home](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12835) results and use needed method for your purposes. Repo has a following structure:

```plain

standard_retriver/ # unified retriever for all methods
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # all info about running retriever
â”œâ”€â”€ build_wiki_index.py # python script to build and run elastic search
â””â”€â”€ run.sh # bash script to run retriever

Method/ # all posible method like `SeaKR`, `rowen` etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt or pyproject.toml # with all needed requirements for method
â””â”€â”€ README.md # with all info about how to run current method
```

To use any method and reproduce the results you need:
* Run the retriever
* Use one of the methods below

# Retriever
Followed by [dragin](https://github.com/oneal2000/DRAGIN) and [SeaKR](https://github.com/THU-KEG/SeaKR). Use the Wikipedia dump and elastic search to build the retriever
All info about how to run a retriever is available in [README.md](./standard_retriever/README.md).

You can use your own retriever.

# Datasets

We used standard datasets (Natural Questions, HotpotQA, 2wikimultihopqa, Squad, Trivia_Q, Musique) for evaluation with 500 sample from every [dataset](./data/)

# Methods

## Adaptive RAG and IRCoT

All code, including our evaluator and dependency installation, is available in the `Adaptive RAG` folder. We made slight modifications to the original Adaptive repository. To run experiments with `Adaptive` and `IRCoT`, refer to the instructions in [README.md](./Adaptive_Rag/README.md).

## FLARE and DRAGIN

All code, including our evaluator and dependency installation, is available in the `DRAGIN` folder. We copied the original DRAGIN repository. To run experiments with FLARE and DRAGIN, follow the instructions in the DRAGIN [README.md](./dragin/README.md).

## Rowen

Install all required dependencies from `rowen/pyproject.toml` and use `run.sh` to reproduce results. More details can be found in the [Rowen README.md](./rowen/README.md).

## SeaKR

All code, including our evaluator and dependency installation, is available in the `SeaKR` folder. We copied the original SeaKR repository and made some modifications in `vllm_uncertainty`. To run experiments, follow the instructions in the [SeaKR README.md](./SeaKR/README.md).

## Uncertainty Estimation Methods

Install all required dependencies from `UC/requirements.txt` and use the scripts from `bin/*.sh` to reproduce results. More details can be found in the [UC README.md](./UC/README.md).
